# NOTE:

I used same format as you used in the class. To make class notes, I used ggplot part 1 markdown file of lecture note as template.

I will keep modifying the contents in next three days and will commit. This is the very first draft. 

Live coding/exercise section  is in progress.

I will add some ppt slides show the pictures of table joining from data wrangling cheat sheet.
